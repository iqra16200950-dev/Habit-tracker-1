🌿Habit Tracker
Hello, productive human!
Welcome to a simple yet satisfying Habit Tracker Web App designed to help you stay consistent, with one tiny checkbox at a time.
This project gives you a clean monthly layout where you can track your daily habits and actually see your progress grow.
Because sometimes the hardest part of building a habit isn’t doing the big things —
it’s showing up for the small ones.
And that’s exactly what this tracker is for.
No complicated analytics.
No productivity pressure.
Just you, your goal, and 30 little squares waiting to be filled.

Every click is a small promise kept.
Every completed day is proof that you showed up.
And over time? Those tiny checkmarks turn into discipline, confidence, and real change.

Whether you’re trying to:

Read daily 
Exercise consistently 
Drink more water 
Study smarter 
Or simply build better routines

This tracker makes your progress visible ( and we know visible progress is powerful and motivating.)
Consistency doesn’t need to be dramatic.
It just needs to be repeated.
And this little web app is here to help you repeat it. 🌱✨
